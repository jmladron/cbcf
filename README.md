# CBCF
Configurable Bucket Cuckoo Filter (CBCF)

## Description

The goal of CBCF is to reduce the False Positive Rate of Cuckoo filters operating below full capacity. This code is used in the paper "CBCF: Making Cuckoo Filters Better than Bloom Filters at Practical Occupancy" by P. Reviriego, J. Mart√≠nez, D. Larrabeiti and S. Pontarelli

## Compilation

This Visual Studio C++ project consists of 3 files: CF.hpp (declaration file), CF.cpp (source file) and main.cpp (test bench)

## Command line arguments

Command line arguments for CBCF are:

- m: filter mode, default value is 1 for cbcf, 0 is for standard cf
- s: filter size, default value is 8192
- o: filter occupancy, default value is 95%
- r: runs (trials), default value is 10000
- b: scrubbing, default value is 1
- i: scrub iterations, default value is 20
- f: fingerprint_bits, default value is f = {12, 15, 18}

#### example: cbcf.exe i=30 r=5000 f=12
